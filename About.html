    <p>Welcome to "Medi Connect," where our mission is to bridge the gap between surplus, unused medicines and individuals who need them. We're a passionate team of developers committed to creating a platform that facilitates safe and efficient medication donations. Our journey began with the recognition that direct user-to-user donations might face challenges, such as logistical complexities and the potential for medicine wastage. In response, we've evolved our concept to include NGOs, optimizing the impact of your donations. Our user-friendly web application, crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides a seamless experience for contributors and recipients alike. As we navigate the dynamic landscape of healthcare philanthropy, our focus remains on user security, reliability, and social impact. Join us in making a difference by connecting surplus medicines to those in need through "Medi Connect.</p>
